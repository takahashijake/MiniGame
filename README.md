# MiniGame

This is a basic turn-based terminal interface game created by me. It isn't meant to 
be anything impressive, but I made it to help me strengthen fundamental 
C++ skills like polymorphism, encapsulation, managing header dependencies, 
and, generally, just good programming. It was fun to build and add the element 
of randomness to the moves and player options of the enemies and players.
